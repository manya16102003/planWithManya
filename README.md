# planWithManya

Welcome to the "Plan Your Trip with Me" project!

This simple yet informative React application allows users to explore various travel destinations through cards containing images, city names, and descriptions. Users can also remove cards they're not interested in by clicking a "Not Interested" button.
This project is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice basic React functionalities like fetching data from an API, 
using the useState hook, and working with components.

Happy coding!
